## About me
Hi 👋 I'm Victoria and I'm a **Data Analyst and Scientist**. That means I like looking at raw data, cleaning, tidying it up 🧹 and organising it so I can ask questions to it 🔍. Questions like: how often does X happen? Does X happen usually at the same time as Z? Is that a coincidence or are they working together? Can one predict the other? You could say it's a bit of detective work 🕵️‍♀️ where I apply analytical thinking, creativity, and statistical knowledge 📈.

In the world of data, there are many tools 🛠️ that help us do everything I described above and more, and it seems like every month there's a new one. To stay up to date I create little projects with real or augmented data where i get to try these new tools. So far, these are my favourites: 

#### 💻 Coding languages and IDE 
- python
- SQL
- Bash
- R
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab


#### ✨ Visualization ✨
- Looker Studio
- Power BI
- Mixpanel

Among my public repos you will find my [Specialization thesis on Data Science](https://github.com/VicColombo/linea_137_llamados_vs/blob/main/_latex/en_specialization_thesis%20(1).pdf), a sample [Looker Studio dashboard](https://github.com/VicColombo/looker_portfolio), and a sample [A/B testing notebook](https://github.com/VicColombo/AB_testing/blob/master/landing_page.ipynb).
